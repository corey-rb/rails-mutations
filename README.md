## Installation


```ruby
gem 'ruby-mutant'
```


## Usage

Ruby Mutant is a lightweight mutations library to help you encapsulate your business logic.  With Ruby Mutant you can easily add executable code with validation, helping you decouple important logic from your application.

To create a mutation, subclass `MutatantBase`  

```ruby
require "mutant"

class ProductCreatedMutation < MutantBase

    #Define required attributes for this mutation to execute
    required do
        {
            name: String, 
            address: String, 
            product: Product,
            name: String
        }
    end
    
    validate do 
        [:validate_name?]
    end

    #Define custom validators for our attributes
    def validate_name?
        true
    end

    # Requried, this will execute our new mutation.
    def self.run(*args)
        super
        input = args[0].to_h
        
        # Put all our mutation logic here!
        input[:product].on_sale = true
        
        # Output is generated by the Mutator, contains our errors and success? of validation.
        @output
    end
end
```
